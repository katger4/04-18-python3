# working with prime numbers
# Loop Practice: 
    # Define a function is_prime() that takes in a whole number and returns whether or not is it prime (divisible only by 1 and self)
        # Check divisibility by seeing if remainder (using modulo %) is 0
    # Define a function find_primes() that takes in a whole number and prints out all of the prime numbers less than the parameter.
        # Use your previous function!
